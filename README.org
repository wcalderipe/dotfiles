A continouos working in progress of my workstation personal configurations.

[[resources/screenshot-emacs.png]]

** DONE Everything must have a purpose
    CLOSED: [2020-07-28 mar. 20:30]

    If I don't know why it's there it will be removed. I normally tend to
    forget things in the long run, so documentation here will be the key.

** DONE Isolation
   CLOSED: [2020-08-17 lun. 08:36]

   Everything must be self contained. I want to be able to add and remove
   configurations or softwares without a hassle - like the headache of hunting
   scattered files and scripts in the codebase.

** DONE Testability
    CLOSED: [2020-07-28 mar. 20:32]

    I like to run my dotfiles in an isolate docker container from time-to-time so I
    can safely test new configurations outside of my daily workstation. This
    practice gives me a minimal level of confidence that I won't blew my whole
    local environment in a Monday morning because I was willing to test a new
    software in my stack.

    The driver that justify this effort is continuous improvement on my workflow.

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      docker build --tag dotfiles .

      docker run -it \
             --volume ~/dev/dotfiles/ansible:/home/tester/dev/dotfiles/ansible \
             dotfiles
    #+END_SRC

    Unfortunately a container have some limitations. For instance, obviously
    everything that depends on a GUI won't be covered (e.g. GNOME and Emacs
    GUI). I also have some custom configurations for my peripherals such as
    keyboard, that isn't covered as well.

** DONE Automation
    CLOSED: [2020-07-28 mar. 20:32]

    After push a button, it must have zero human interaction until
    everything is done.

    I'm using Ansible to manage system dependencies and configuration
    orchestration.

    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      ansible-playbook \
          --inventory ./ansible/hosts \
          --tags "emacs" \
          --skip-tags "deps" \
          ./ansible/main.yml
    #+END_SRC

** Emacs Tabs

   I normally have multiple projects open at the same time in Emacs and I like
   to have them separated by workspace. For that, I have been using [[https://depp.brause.cc/eyebrowse/][eyebrowse]]
   with [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]].

   Hit =C-c + t= to see the menu.

** Org

*** Styled HTML exports

    I often share thoughts and ideas with other people in my daily basis. For
    that I like to export my Org notes to HTML and then PDF. Thus, I created a
    minimal stylesheet that mimics GitHub's Markdown styles for the features I
    use most in Org. See [[resources/org.css][org.css]].

    Add the snippet below to include the styles in a Org file.

    #+begin_src org
      ,#+OPTIONS: html-style:nil html-postamble:nil num:nil
      ,#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="__REPLACE_ME_WITH REAL_LINK__"/>
    #+end_src

**** TODO Find a proper place to host the org.css file

     GitHub pages might be a good candidate.

** PDF Operations

   To convert HTML to PDF I use [[https://wkhtmltopdf.org/][wkhtmltopdf]].

   #+begin_src shell
     wkhtmltopdf SOURCE.html TARGET.pdf
   #+end_src
